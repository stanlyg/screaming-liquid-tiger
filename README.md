# Screaming Liquid Tiger

Simple script to automatically generate valid RSS and Atom feeds from a list of media files in the same folder. Written in PHP to enable use even on the cheapest shared host.

I wrote this because I wanted an easy way to use [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) to listen to my audiobooks. However, I don't recommend it anymore since the author decided to make it free but to include annoying ads that you can only get rid of by a subscription of $10 per year. In my view this is an unreasonable price to ask for such an app. I'm using [Pocket Casts](http://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/) now. You should check it out. Podcast players are ideal applications for this, contrary to generic media players. It is also trivial to be adapted to other uses and file types.

* Automatically gets media files from same folder, no fiddling with a GUI
* Automatically sets file modification date
* Automatically sets per-file MIME type
* Automatically sets file size
* Generates valid RSS and Atom feeds for maximum compatibility
* Automatically extracts tag information when `mediainfo` is installed

## Caffeinating

When you find this helpful, you could buy me a coffee. Keeping me properly caffeinated accelerates things. And it would really make my day. Kindness of strangers and all that. If you can't or won't, no hard feelings. It's available completely free for a reason. Still, it would be awesome.

## Installation and Usage

* Upload `index.php` file to a folder on a web server running PHP 5.4 or higher.
* Edit the configuration variables if needed and upload media files of any kind.
* Optionally make sure `mediainfo` is installed. Set the `$mediainfo_check` variable to `true` and follow the instructions displayed. If no instructions show but your feed appears, it already works.

For personal podcasting use, those should obviously be audio files but you can use it with any kind of file.

For easier upgrades, you can now use a `config.php` file (included) to set your options. Just rename `config.php.default` to `config.php` and make your adjustments. The script will autodetect if it is present. If not, it will fall back to its included defaults.

If you have a rather large collection of files, you may want to set up a cronjob running the script, redirecting its output to an XML file like so:

```cron
*/15 * * * * curl http://example.com/folder/index.php > /usr/local/www/podcast.xml
```

## How to Create Your Own Audiobooks

There are several approaches but the one I like best is converting CDs or audio files to a 'Bookmarkable MP4 File', most commonly spotted by its extension `.m4b`. Here's a quick list of software you can use.

For Mac OS X, take a look at [Audiobook Builder](http://www.splasm.com/audiobookbuilder/). It's a fantastic and inexpensive piece of software. It's what I use.

For Windows, I hear good things about  [Chapter and Verse](http://lodensoftware.com/chapter-and-verse/). You'll need both the application and iTunes for it to work.

For Linux, there are two older projects worth mentioning: [m4baker](https://github.com/crabmanX/m4baker) and [zak](https://code.google.com/p/zak/). If those won't do, you could always script the hell out of `ffmpeg`, `mp4v2` and `MP4tools`.
